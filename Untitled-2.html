
Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of each line of Batter my heart, three-person'd God with the literary devices at work:

1. Batter my heart, three-person'd God,

Metaphor: The "battering" of the heart is a metaphor for intense spiritual and emotional transformation, representing a dramatic change or "breaking" of the speaker's soul.
Apostrophe: The speaker is directly addressing God, who is referred to as "three-person'd" (the Holy Trinity), as though in a conversation.
2. For you as yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;

List/Asyndeton: The use of verbs "knock, breathe, shine, and seek" shows a list of actions God performs. The absence of conjunctions (asyndeton) speeds up the rhythm, emphasizing the various ways God is approaching the speaker.
Alliteration: The repetition of the "b" sound in "breathe, shine" adds a musical quality to the line.
3. That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend

Antithesis: The line contrasts "rise and stand" with "o'erthrow me," using opposing ideas to show the internal conflict of wanting renewal through violent spiritual transformation.
Imperative: The speaker's commanding tone ("o'erthrow me") reflects his desperate plea for radical change.
4. Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.

Anaphora: The repetition of the imperative verbs ("break, blow, burn") emphasizes the intensity of the speaker's request for divine intervention.
Imagery: The verbs evoke powerful sensory images, especially destructive ones like "break," "blow," and "burn," which reflect the speaker’s desire for complete spiritual renewal.
5. I, like an usurp'd town, to another due,

Simile: The speaker compares himself to a "usurp'd town" to show that he feels overrun by external forces, particularly sin or temptation.
Allusion: The reference to a "town" being usurped evokes images of conquest and loss of control, symbolizing the speaker’s lack of agency in his spiritual state.
6. Labour to admit you, but O, to no end;

Alliteration: The repetition of the "l" sound in "Labour" and "admit" adds rhythm to the line and suggests the speaker’s ongoing effort.
Paradox: "Labour to admit you, but O, to no end" creates a sense of frustration, showing that despite the effort, the speaker remains incapable of fully surrendering to God.
7. Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,

Personification: "Reason" is given the human quality of being a "viceroy," implying that it is supposed to govern or protect the speaker’s actions in place of God.
Metaphor: The use of "viceroy" suggests that Reason is meant to rule over the speaker, yet is failing in this task.
8. But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.

Metaphor: Reason is described as "captived," implying that it is imprisoned or powerless, suggesting a loss of control over the speaker’s will.
Antithesis: "Weak or untrue" contrasts the expected strength of Reason with its failure to defend the speaker’s soul, further highlighting the conflict.
9. Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain,

Irony: There's irony in the speaker’s love for God, especially since he feels torn between his love for God and his sinfulness.
Pathos: The speaker’s emotional appeal to God highlights his sincere but conflicted devotion.
10. But am betrothed unto your enemy;

Metaphor: The concept of being "betrothed" to God’s enemy (sin or the Devil) emphasizes the speaker’s sense of being bound or trapped by forces opposing God.
Personification: God’s "enemy" is treated as a rival lover, suggesting that sin is a destructive force with a hold on the speaker.
11. Divorce me, untie or break that knot again,

Metaphor: The "knot" is a metaphor for the spiritual and moral bond that the speaker feels trapped in, suggesting that sin or the devil has tied him to an unholy commitment.
Imperative: The speaker is again commanding God, asking for a radical severing of this bond.
12. Take me to you, imprison me, for I

Imperative: The speaker continues to plead for God's intervention, asking to be "imprisoned," which, paradoxically, he sees as a form of liberation.
Irony: The idea of "imprisonment" as freedom demonstrates the speaker's longing for complete surrender to God, even through submission.
13. Except you entrall me, never shall be free,

Paradox: The idea that the speaker must be "entrall(ed)" or bound by God in order to be "free" reveals the paradox at the heart of the poem: only through submission to God can the speaker find true freedom.
Metaphor: "Entrall me" (or enthrall) is a metaphor for being captivated or taken under God's control, representing spiritual liberation through complete devotion.
14. Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.

Paradox: "Ravish" here is used in a positive sense, signifying a violent but necessary spiritual transformation. The speaker believes chastity (purity) can only be attained through this overpowering act of divine intervention.
Oxymoron: The contrast between "ravish" (violence) and "chaste" (purity) creates an oxymoron that highlights the paradoxical nature of the speaker's plea.
This sonnet is filled with intense imagery, metaphors, paradoxes, and a sense of urgency, all of which combine to create a dramatic, emotionally charged request for divine intervention and transformation. Each line works with both literal and figurative meanings to explore the tension between human frailty and the overwhelming power of God.
